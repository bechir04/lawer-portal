# üê≥ What is Docker and Do You Need It?

## What is Docker?
Docker is a tool that packages your application and all its dependencies into a "container" - think of it like a shipping container that has everything your app needs to run.

## Do You Need Docker for This Project?
**NO!** For this legal portal project, you don't need Docker at all.

## Why We Removed Docker Files
- **Simpler Setup**: Just run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
- **Easier Development**: No need to learn Docker commands
- **Direct Access**: You can directly edit files and see changes immediately
- **Beginner Friendly**: Focus on learning the application, not containerization

## When Would You Use Docker?
- **Team Development**: When multiple developers need identical environments
- **Production Deployment**: For consistent server environments
- **Complex Applications**: With multiple databases and services

## Your Simple Setup Instead
1. Install Node.js on your computer
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
4. That's it! No Docker needed.

## If Someone Mentions Docker
Just tell them: "I'm running this directly with Node.js for simplicity."
